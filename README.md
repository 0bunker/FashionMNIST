# FashionMNIST Computer Vision Project

## Introduction
This project focuses on implementing and training a machine learning model to recognize and classify images from the FashionMNIST dataset. FashionMNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article images, consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes.

## Project Objective
The primary goal of this project is to develop an accurate and efficient model for classifying fashion products based on their images. This can be particularly useful in various applications such as automated tagging of products, recommendation systems, and more.

## Dataset
The FashionMNIST dataset is used, which is a more challenging replacement for the original MNIST dataset. It contains images of various fashion products divided into classes like T-shirts, trousers, pullovers, dresses, coats, sandals, shirts, sneakers, bags, and ankle boots.

## Methodology
- **Data Preprocessing**: Outline how the data is preprocessed (e.g., normalization, augmentation).
- **Model Architecture**: Describe the architecture of the model used (e.g., Convolutional Neural Network).
- **Training**: Detail the training process including loss functions, optimizers, and hyperparameters.
- **Evaluation**: Explain how the model is evaluated (e.g., accuracy, confusion matrix).

## Results
Summarize the results obtained from the model. Include key metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. You can also add graphs or charts to represent the results visually.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pytorch
- Pandas
- Numpy

## Installation and Usage
Provide instructions on how to install and run the project.
